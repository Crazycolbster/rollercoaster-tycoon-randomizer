Forked from https://github.com/Justis-Lamanna/OpenRCT2-CrowdControl

Crowd Control plugins for OpenRCT2

Contained within this project are two important pieces of code:
1. `OpenRCT2.cs` contains the list of Crowd Control effects, and must be loaded into your Crowd Control SDK for testing.
2. `CCPlugin.ts` contains the plugin code for RCT2. It must be transpiled into JavaScript, and loaded into the /plugin directory of your OpenRCT2 instance.
