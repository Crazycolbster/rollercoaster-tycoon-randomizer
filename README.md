# RollerCoaster Tycoon Randomizer
RollerCoaster Tycoon Randomizer mod for RCT1 and RCT2 inside of [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/).

You'll need a development build of OpenRCT2 from https://openrct2.org/downloads/develop/latest

Copy the `rctrando.js` file into the OpenRCT2 plugin folder, which is usually `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin\`

Currently v0.3 randomizes:
* scenario goals
* scenario length
* park values such as starting cash, starting bank loan amount, maxBankLoan, landPrice
* park flags such as difficultGuestGeneration, forbidMarketingCampaigns, and preferMoreIntenseRides
* the base stats of each ride type
    * runningCost, excitement, intensity, and nausea
