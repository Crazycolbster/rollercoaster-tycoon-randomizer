# RollerCoaster Tycoon Randomizer
RollerCoaster Tycoon Randomizer mod for RCT1 and RCT2 inside of [OpenRCT2](https://openrct2.org/).

You'll need OpenRCT2 v0.4.0 or later from https://openrct2.org/downloads/releases/latest

Download the `rctrando.js` file from [the releases page](https://github.com/Die4Ever/rollercoaster-tycoon-randomizer/releases) and copy it into the OpenRCT2 plugin folder, which is usually `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\OpenRCT2\plugin\`

Currently v0.6 randomizes:
* scenario goals
* scenario length
* park values such as starting cash, starting bank loan amount, maxBankLoan, landPrice
* park flags such as difficultGuestGeneration, forbidMarketingCampaigns, and preferMoreIntenseRides
* the base stats of each ride type
    * runningCost, excitement, intensity, and nausea
* Ride Type Stat Re-rolls
    * How often to rerandomize the stats for ride types. Build the Theme Park of Theseus.
    * You will get notifications at the bottom of the screen when these re-rolls happen.

The Randomization Range option specifies how much values can be changed from their original. Low will have a narrow range so the values are close to their originals, while Extreme can give much wider variety. This is mostly separate from difficulty, but Extreme can give unpredictable results.
